# 5. Text Manipulation

# 5.1 Basic functionalities
# - Search: grep, grepl
# - Search / Replace: gsub
# - Count length: nchar
# - Extract: substring(text, first, last)

# 5.2 Paste character vectors together
# - paste, paste0 and collapse

# 5.3 Split and Combine
# - strsplit -> list of vector with splitted values
# - combine: unlist + matrix

# EXERCISE
# - Replace all occurences of `world` with `universe` in the following vector
# x <- c("Hello world!", "The world rocks", "Welcome to the R world")
# - Find all elements which start with "var" (logical or index)
# y <- c("var1", "x2", "var4", "var2", "y", "test", "try")
# - Convert the following vector into a 4x2 matrix (split along `_`)
# z <- c("drugA_11", "drugB_123", "drugC_99", "drugD_12")
